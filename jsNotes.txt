## JavaScript data types and data structures

Here are the built-in data structures available in JavaScript and what properties they have.

# Primitive values 
    -Boolean type
    -Null type
    -Undefined type
    -Number type
    -String type

Objects (collections of properties)

# Dynamic typing

JavaScript is a loosely typed and dynamic language. Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types:

let foo = 42;    // foo is now a number
foo     = 'bar'; // foo is now a string
foo     = true;  // foo is now a boolean


Classes
    - Template 
    - Instantiating a new object 
    - Have a constructors
    - To create an instance use "new"
    - use the keyword "class"

Constructor

- method sets the initial value of the class
